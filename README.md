# FCC-Project-Twitch-Stream
Intermediate level front end project as part of [FreeCodeCamp][fcc] using [Twitch API][twitchAPI].


**Hosted on Github Pages**  
This app can be accessed through [https://vijayabharathib.github.io/fcc-project-twitch-stream/public]("https://vijayabharathib.github.io/fcc-project-twitch-stream/public" "Twitch TV stream project on github pages").  

**Challenges**  
Getting the cross origin request (CORS) out of the way was the time consuming one for this API. Included ajax to state 'jsonp' as dataType.
